* Drag the "Length of Wire" slider to change where the wire is cut and see how the dimensions of the two squares change.

 _Make a prediction_: Where should the wire be cut so that the total area enclosed by both squares is a maximum? Explain.

* Click the Check Box "Show Areas" to see the area of each object. Again, use the slider or drag the triangular marker to change where the wire is cut and see how the areas of the two shapes change. Also notice how the total area changes.
* Was your prediction correct? Why or why not?
